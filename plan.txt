// DATA PLAN:

Runner data:
Runner {
	name: string,
	group: string,
	category: string,			(options: led, solo, explorer, netvet)
	noMembers: number,
	noMembersRetired: number,		(if noMembersRetired - noMembers < 4, then retired = true)

APP:
	
	> Sign in using google auth - when signed in, set to true - see teams not logged in

	> Upload whenever connection available, only upload photo for manual
	> Save name as 'Getting name... (team 003)', on upload bind name from DB
	> If catch is before or after game, catch.status = denied - it will be skipped
	> If ready, deny catch if out of bounds
	> Set catch to 'checked after upload', in case of catches added after leaderboard has started generating
	> At end check catches with QR code for checkin (in settings > checkin code)
	
	Would this mean array of catches just on catcher documents, not whole collection?
		No - you need to compare each catch to catches from other catchers for the half hour check



The big one (this might work?!):

// If a previous leaderboard has already been created, set all catch statuses to 'pending'

for (catch of catches) {
	if (catch.status != 'denied') {

		// Approve catch & work out value
		catch.status = 'approved'
		catch.catchValue - runner.catches *2 // Work out value of catch from which no. catch it is
		catcher.points += catch.catchValue // Add this catch's point value to the catcher's point score
		runner.catches++ // Add catch to runner's points
		
		// Remove invalid catches after this
		let hour = catch.time + 60mins
		let halfHour = catch.time + 30mins

		for (catchCheck of catches) {
			if (catch.time is between catch.time and halfHour) {
				catchCheck.status = 'denied'
				catchCheck.reason = 'Team caught less than 30 mins ago'
			}
			else if (catchCheck.time is between catch.time and hour && catch.catcher == catchCheck.catcher) {
				catchCheck.status = 'denied'
				catchCheck.reason = 'Team was caught by same catcher in last hour'
			}
			else if (catchCheck.time > hour){
				break // Don't go through catches after an hour - they don't matter
			}
		}
	}
}

// At end, set "up to date" to true, if catch added, set it to false.


// Leaderboard:
Show for overall, solo, lead, explorer, net-vet
	Overall - don't show net-vet
		Rank | Team name | Position | Catches | First Catch Time

// Use selectize.js for adding a catch - team names

// https://preview-dev.tabler.io/users.html for list of runners + catchers

// Checkin:

	- Connect session to phone / manual option
	- First team member scanned / typed in code / typed team name
	- Shows 4/7 members accounted for
	- Shows team name, members + any dropouts, Catches other side
	- Each member then scanned in
	- Option to undo checkin for fuckups
	- When full team checked in, confirm, next team
	- Option to disqualify

// For app if wristbands?:
	
	- For manual input, ensure 4 digits |_| |_| |_| |_|
	- Each wristband has 3 digit team code + team member, e.g.:
		Team 45, member 3 would be 0453
